# xctrl - SDX Controller

This controller is in charge of pushing all the flow rules to the SDX fabric that are necessary to get the SDX running.

## Run xctrl

```bash
$ cd ~/iSDX/xctrl/
$ ./xctrl.py <path of config file>
```

A sample config file (xctrl.cfg) is provided. In the config file the vmac mode and fabric setup has to be specified:

* vmac mode - at the moment only superset mode is supported "Superset"

* fabric setup - either "Multi-Switch" or "Multi-Table"
